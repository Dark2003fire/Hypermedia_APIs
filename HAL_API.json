/*


HAL is an older spec to be easily consumed
across multiple formats including XML and JSON. One of the key strengths
of HAL is that it is nestable, meaning that _links can be incorporated within
each item of a collection. HAL also incorporates CURIES, a feature that
makes it unique in that it allows for inclusion of documentation links in the
Weaknesses: Strengths:  response, though they are tightly coupled to the link name. HAL is one of
the most supported and widely used hypermedia specs out there today,
and is supported by a strong and vocal community
